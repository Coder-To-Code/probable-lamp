      <li><h3> The First one</h3></li>
      
         <ul>
            <li><h4>The Wolf of The Wall Street</h4></li>
                  This one was like totally crazy thought the man itself was mind blowing so what happens in short is something like this:
                  
                  <p>A drug addict but the movie itself was Jordan Belfort takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess.</p>

      <li><h3>The Second One</h3></li>
         <ul>
            <li><h4>Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story</h4></li>
                  This too was ming blowing how an indian guy who was a typical nobody just manages to achieve the feat of using bank br'r money which was already being used in the stock market by many brokers and managed to make so much money that it is known as one of the biggest scams in India which at the time was the biggest yet approximate to a whooping amount of 5000 crores which was like shown to the media and who knows what more was just not shown.
         </ul>   
      

      <li><h3>The Third One</h3></li>
         <ul>
            <li><h4>Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story</h4></li>
                  The Satyam scandal was a corporate fraud that took place at the India-based outsourcing company Satyam Computer Services. The scandal involved the company's founder and directors falsifying accounts, inflating the share price, and stealing money from the company. The money was largely invested in property.

                     The scandal was discovered in late 2008 when the Hyderabad property market crashed, and the trail led back to Satyam. In 2009, the company's chairman, Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, confessed to the fraud and resigned from the board. Tech Mahindra purchased Satyam in April 2009 and renamed it Mahindra Satyam. Mahindra Satyam merged with Tech Mahindra on June 24, 2013.
